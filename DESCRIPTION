Title: Confounder-adjusted Outcome-guided dimension Reduction and Discriminant Effect size
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zihan Zhu, Ruitao Liu
Maintainer: Ruitao Liu <rxl761@case.edu>
Description: Implements a statistical framework for outcome-driven beta diversity 
    analysis while adjusting for confounders. The method begins with 
    Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) on the abundance table, followed 
    by projection onto the orthogonal complement of the confounder space 
    to remove confounder-associated variation. Sparse Partial Least Squares 
    (sPLS) is then applied to extract components associated with the outcome. 
    Finally, taxa-level linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores are computed 
    to quantify each taxon's contribution to outcome-associated beta diversity. 
    This unified score facilitates both global group separation assessment 
    and identification of driving taxa.
