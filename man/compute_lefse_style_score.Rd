\title{Compute LEfSe-Style Effect Size Scores for Features}
\usage{
compute_lefse_style_score(X, Y, eps = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of features (samples Ã— features), such as OTU abundances or component scores.}

\item{Y}{A factor vector of class labels corresponding to rows of \code{X}. Must contain at least two levels.}

\item{eps}{A small number added to denominators to avoid division by zero or log(0). Default is \code{1e-6}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of LEfSe-style scores (length = number of features).
  For binary classes, the scores are signed \code{log10}-transformed effect sizes.
  For multi-class, the scores are unsigned maximum standardized pairwise differences.
}
\description{
This function computes a LEfSe-style score for each feature, based on standardized group
differences. For two-class problems, it returns signed log-transformed effect sizes. For
multi-class problems, it returns the maximum absolute pairwise standardized difference.
}
\details{
The function mimics the scoring strategy in the LEfSe tool by computing the difference in means
between groups standardized by the pooled standard deviation. For two groups, this is the
standardized effect size, log-transformed for interpretability. For multiple groups, the
maximum pairwise absolute standardized difference is returned.
