\title{Identify Driving Taxa Using Mantel Correlation and LEfSe-Style LDA Scores}
\usage{
driving.taxa.lda(OTU, CORDE_res, dist_method, ncore = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{OTU}{A numeric matrix of OTU/taxa abundances with taxa as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{CORDE_res}{A list output from the \code{CORDE} method containing elements:
\code{Loadings} (taxa loadings), \code{Embeddings} (sample coordinates),
\code{Coordinates} (low-dimensional representations), and \code{Y} (class labels).}

\item{dist_method}{Character string specifying the dissimilarity metric used,
consistent with the one used in the \code{CORDE} method (e.g., "bray").}

\item{n_cores}{Number of CPU cores to use for parallel computation (default = 4).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of driving scores for each taxon.
  Higher scores indicate stronger contributions to the observed separation in the ordination space.
}
\description{
This function quantifies the importance of taxa in driving sample-level ordination patterns
by integrating Mantel correlations between taxa profiles and ordination embeddings,
LDA-based separation scores, and ordination loadings.
}
\details{
The driving score integrates three components:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Mantel correlation} between individual taxa and ordination axes.
  \item \strong{LDA-style group separation scores} from sample ordination coordinates.
  \item \strong{Normalized taxa loadings} indicating taxa contributions to axes.
}
Each component is normalized, and scores are combined via weighted matrix multiplication,
scaled by 100 for interpretability.
