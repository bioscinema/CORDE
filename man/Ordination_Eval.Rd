\title{Evaluate Ordination Coordinates Across Multiple Metrics}
\usage{
Ordination_Eval(D, Coordinates, expl_var, Y, X, ncomp = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{Original high-dimensional dissimilarity matrix (samples × samples).}

\item{Coordinates}{Ordination coordinates (samples × ncomp).}

\item{expl_var}{Vector of explained variance per component (usually from PCoA or sPLS).}

\item{Y}{Outcome vector (factor or numeric).}

\item{X}{Confounder matrix (samples × covariates), used to compute confounder-associated R².}

\item{ncomp}{Number of ordination components (default: 2).}
}
\value{
A named list of evaluation metrics, including:
\describe{
  \item{ICR}{Information Compression Rate: total variance explained by first two components.}
  \item{TW}{Trustworthiness: neighbor preservation from low- to high-dimensional space.}
  \item{Cont}{Continuity: neighbor preservation from high- to low-dimensional space.}
  \item{Rand}{Rand index of clustering agreement.}
  \item{ARand}{Adjusted Rand index.}
  \item{ASil}{Average silhouette width from PAM clustering.}
  \item{CARI}{Confounder-adjusted R² improvement (McFadden).}
  \item{rCMI}{Relative conditional mutual information between clustering and outcome.}
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates the quality of a low-dimensional ordination (e.g., CORDE or PCoA)
based on clustering, classification, and neighborhood preservation metrics.
