\title{Evaluate Ordination Quality Using Multiple Metrics}
\usage{
Ordination_Eval(D, Coordinates, expl_var, Y, X, ncomp = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{A dissimilarity matrix (e.g., Bray-Curtis, UniFrac).}

\item{Coordinates}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the ordination coordinates.}

\item{expl_var}{A numeric vector of explained variance for the axes (e.g., from PCA).}

\item{Y}{A factor or vector indicating the true group labels for each sample (e.g., phenotype).}

\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of confounder variables to adjust for (e.g., batch, age).}

\item{ncomp}{Integer specifying the number of components (default = 2).}
}
\value{
A named list containing the following evaluation metrics:
\describe{
  \item{ICR}{Information compression rate (sum of explained variance from first `ncomp` components).}
  \item{TW}{Trustworthiness (neighborhood preservation from low-dim to high-dim).}
  \item{Cont}{Continuity (neighborhood preservation from high-dim to low-dim).}
  \item{Rand}{Rand index between clustering from PAM and true labels.}
  \item{ARand}{Adjusted Rand index (ARI).}
  \item{ASil}{Average silhouette width of PAM clustering in 2D space.}
  \item{CARI}{Confounder-associated R² improvement (from McFadden's pseudo-R²).}
  \item{rCMI}{Relative conditional mutual information between clustering and outcome, conditioned on confounders.}
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates the quality of an ordination (e.g., from PCA, t-SNE, CORDE)
based on trustworthiness, continuity, clustering accuracy, silhouette width, and
confounder association.
